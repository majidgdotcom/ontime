# Ontime

Ontime is a powerful web application tailored for medical offices and clinics. It simplifies appointment booking, client file management, and payment tracking while also supporting customer engagement through a Customer Club feature. The platform includes robust reporting tools, making it a valuable asset for CEOs and administrators.

As the product owner and lead developer, I spearheaded the R&D efforts and development process, ensuring a user-friendly experience and scalable architecture.
